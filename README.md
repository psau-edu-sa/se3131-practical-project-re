# Formal specification 
## Using petri-net we formally specfied this system :

- This petri net ensures that each traffic light work on its own without interubting other traffic light .

- The first 2 traffic lights in the first path are allowed to be green at the same time while the rest is red .

- The second 2 traffic lights in path 2 are allowed to be green at the same time while the rest are red .

- The third traffic light in the 3rd path is allowed to be green while the rest are red .

- The forth traffic light in the forth path is allowed to be green while the rest are red .

- The traffic lights must work in order.
